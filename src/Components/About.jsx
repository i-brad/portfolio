				<h3>Who am I?</h3>
				<p>
					I'm a front-end developer based in Nigeria. I started my coding career
					back in 2019 while I was still in college. It was challenging because
					I had to balance it with school.
				</p>
				<p>
					The primary area of my interest is in front-end development, although
					I know a bit of backend development. But making little steps without
					being in haste has help me a lot. On the long run, I plan to become a
					full-stack developer.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my years of learning, I have been able to work voluntarily, work
					with teams, work as an intern and lots more. I currently work as a
					freelance developer with some selected freelance client. Build
					personal projects on my free time. Improve my UI/UX skill and
					volunteer for free projects.
				</p>

				<h3>Why hire me?</h3>
				<p>
					I love working on products that contribute to the growth of
					businesses. I don't just program or write codes, I help client solve
					problems and increase the Return On Investments(ROI) by building
					websites that converts prospects into loyal customers. Client
					satisfaction is my top most priority.{" "}
